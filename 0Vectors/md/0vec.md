# Vectors: Geometric View

## Definition of Vectors

> **Definition 1.1.1 Vectors**
> 
> Quantities that have both a **magnitude** (the "how much" or "how big" part) and a **direction** in space. The magnitude of a vector is also called its **norm** or **length**.

Regarding the notation of vectors, different books or authors have different habits. You may see **A** (boldface letter), $\overrightarrow{A}$ (with an arrow above), $\overrightarrow{\textbf{A}}$ (both boldface and arrow) etc. I will stick to $\overrightarrow{A}$, because I like using boldface letters to make readers pay attention to those words. Formally, we have:

- Position vector of point $A$ which starts at the origin: $\overrightarrow{OA}$. We denote its magnitude as $|\overrightarrow{OA}|$[^1] or $OA$.
- Displacement vector of $B$ relative to $A$: $\overrightarrow{AB}$. Its length is $|\overrightarrow{AB}|$.

Finally, we say **two vectors are equal** if they have the same magnitude and direction, and **the negative of a vector $\overrightarrow{a}$** is the vector parallel to $\overrightarrow{a}$ with the same length but in the opposite direction. It is denoted $-\overrightarrow{a}$.
