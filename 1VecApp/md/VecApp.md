# Lines

## Equation of Lines

Knowing a point on a line and the direction of the line (the slope of the line in a 2-D plane), we can get an equation of the line in a 2-D plane using the point-slope form. A similar idea applies to lines in 3-D space. The key thing is that, with the knowledge of vectors, we have a powerful tool to "describe" the direction of the line. Just see the picture below:

First, see Figure 1, we know a point $A$ on the line, then we know its direction described by the vector $\overrightarrow{b}$. Then we can actually represent any points on the line, say for the point $R$ we have $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{a} + \lambda \overrightarrow{b}$ (here, we don't know the exact length of $AR$, so we don't know exactly the value of $\lambda$). For Figure 2, we know $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and direction $\overrightarrow{v}$. Similarly, for point $P$, we have $\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{r_0} + 1 \overrightarrow{v}$.

From the Figure 3 below, it is not hard to deduce the so-called **vector equation** of a line $L$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{Vector Equation: }
\overrightarrow{r} = \overrightarrow{r_0} + t \overrightarrow{v}
\end{equation}
$$
